## Usage

1. Sign up or log in to the application
2. Link your bank account using Plaid
3. Navigate to the Chat page
4. Ask questions about your transaction history, such as:
   - "How much did I spend on groceries last month?"
   - "What are my largest expenses?"
   - "Show me my recent transactions"
   - "What's my average daily spending?"

## Architecture

The chatbot is built using the following components:

- **Backend**: Flask server with LangChain and OpenAI integration
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and chat history
- **Plaid**: For fetching transaction history

## Implementation Details

The chatbot uses LangChain to create a conversational chain that:

1. Fetches the user's transaction history from Plaid
2. Formats the transaction history for the language model
3. Uses the transaction history as context for answering user questions
4. Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses

The system prompt instructs the model to act as a helpful financial assistant that uses the transaction history to provide personalized financial advice and answer questions.
